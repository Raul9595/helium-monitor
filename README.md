# Helium monitor

Tools for monitoring your helium hotspot miner. 

## API

- `/earnings`: for fetching hotspot's earnings
- `/earnings-bot`: for sending hotspot's earnings to a bot of your choice. Currently telegram is supported. 

## Menu bar app

Cross platform app for monitoring your helium device. Works with macOS, Windows and Ubuntu. 

### How to use?

Grab the latest installer for your PC from [Github releases](https://github.com/maskaravivek/helium-monitor/releases/) and simply install it. 

#### Installation issues

**Mac** 

The apps haven't been signed since I don't have an active developer account. If there's enough interest, I will release a signed version. 

Until then, depending on your preferences, you might have to manually click on **Open anyway** from **Security & Privacy**. These links([here](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac) and [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491)) might be helpful.

## Disclaimer

The app doesn't collect any data whatsoever. In future, I am planning to add Google analytics for page views but no other information will ever be collected. Moreover, all the code including backend APIs and frontend application is open source.
